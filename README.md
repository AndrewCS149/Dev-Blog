# The Dev Blog

*Author* - Andrew Smith

### Why?
Like many fellow developers out there, I have a lingering desire to create my own video game. 
At the time of writing this, I haven't the slightest idea of what this game will encompass. I simply know
that if I want to develop a real, playable game, I must begin somewhere and see it through to 
the end. That is what lead me to this project, The Dev Blog. 

The Dev Blog is a way to keep me accountable, track my progress, and most importantly, update all of you. 
Sure, there are already numerous applications and tools out there that do almost exactly everything I just mentioned. 
This project will allow me to maintain my programming skills and formulate game ideas simultaneously.
